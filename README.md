## Escape VR

Escape VR is a horror game built using Unity for the Oculus Rift. Download is in the link provided below.

Alone with only a flashlight and instructions on a wall,
you must find a way to escape the forest by traversing the maze near the graveyard. In order to escape
you must find the key hidden in one of the treasure chests but beware of the Witch near the grave site.
Avoid the Witch's deadly gaze or face the ultimate punishment. Luckily for you there are safety beacons
in which the Witch can not follow. The lamp posts in the maze offer safety from her clutches so that you
can avoid her path. Use them to your advantage in order to take the key back to the exit.

### Prerequisites

If you want to download the project follow this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fBAbIAsPsJbha9YmoLRxbFyNMACCMp34?usp=sharing)
The entire game is built using Unity and C#. You're going to need a decent amount of space to download the entire folder. Because Escape VR is/was our first gaming project, we weren't exactly looking for the best optimizations and kept the asset count high. That's why we can't host the game on Github, too much content for a small game.

## Getting Started

Just download the entire project and open the Unity Editor. When the editor is open select the EscapeVR folder as the project you want to open. Once open in your Assets screen click on the final project scene. This will open up the entire scene in the editor. From there you can browse the assets we used, move them around and alter them as you wish.

Note that if you run the game we have two avatar types to play as. Just select and check or uncheck them in the editor if you want to use the Oculus headset or just want to use your mouse and keyboard. If you're using an Oculus headset with motion controllers make sure to hold on to the flash light with the trigger or risk having the flash light float out into space.
